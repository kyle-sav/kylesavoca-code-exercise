This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hey there! If you're reading this, this is Kyle. This is just a simple swipeable gallery.
It pulls mock data from a local json file and populates the gallery, as well
as sends data back up from a child element to its parent to open a dialog modal with information pertaining to that specific recipe.
It also is mobile responsive, if you emulate an iPhone in Chrome's web inspector it should become full width.

To run its pretty simple, just npm install and npm start.

Thank you!
Kyle
